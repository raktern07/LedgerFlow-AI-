so basically we are providing an accounting service and we wants to make a website for that, so basically we are providing service in which clients or CA firms can simply pass pdfs and images files directly via whatsapp and that will make entries directly onto the tally platform via our AI agent running in the backend which under the hood connects via tally and places all data directly on the tally for that company and generated the pdfs which clients can export directly, this is happening via openclaw which have whatsapp as an integrated interface so that CA persons can communicate via whatsapp

Below is the detailed given version of it

# TallyPrime (CA) Skill

Connect to a **locally running** TallyPrime instance via its **XML-over-HTTP** interface. All requests are HTTP POST to `$TALLY_URL` (commonly `http://localhost:9000`) with an XML body.

- **No cloud API**: TallyPrime must be open/running on the user’s machine.
- **Multi-company**: Always use the correct `SVCURRENTCOMPANY` (exact spelling).

## Hero Use Case: WhatsApp invoice → Tally entry

Goal: zero manual entry for CAs handling many clients.

1. Read bill/invoice (PDF/image) and extract: company, party, GSTIN, date, invoice no, taxable, tax, total, ledger mapping.
2. Ensure masters exist: party ledger, purchase/sales ledger, GST ledger(s), bank/cash ledger (if needed).
3. Post voucher with a **unique GUID**.
4. Confirm a summary back to the user.

## When to use this skill

Use when the user asks to:

- Post entries: purchase, sales, receipt, payment, journal, contra, credit note, debit note
- Check reports: day book, trial balance, balance sheet, profit & loss, ledger statement, outstandings, GST
- Manage masters: create/alter ledgers, groups, stock items/UOM (inventory clients)
- Fix data: alter or cancel a voucher

## Critical rules (must follow)

1. **Never assume company**: if not explicit, ask which company to use before posting.
2. **Never guess ledgers**: verify ledgers exist before voucher import; create missing masters first.
3. **Dates are `YYYYMMDD`** (no separators).
4. **Idempotency**: always set a stable unique `GUID` per voucher to prevent duplicates on retries.
5. **Balance vouchers**: total debits must equal total credits (Tally error: “Voucher totals do not match!”).
6. **Escape XML**: narration/party names may contain `&` → use `&amp;` in XML.
7. **Posting is write operation**: confirm intent (and company) before any create/alter/cancel.
8. **Prefer bill-wise allocations** for party ledgers to keep outstandings correct (see `reference/vouchers.md`).
9. **Accounting-only vouchers (no inventory items)**: set `<ISINVOICE>No</ISINVOICE>` and place the **party ledger entry first** in the `ALLLEDGERENTRIES.LIST` sequence. This makes the Day Book "Particulars" column show the party name (not the expense/purchase ledger) and defaults the voucher to the clean "As Voucher" view. Only use `ISINVOICE=Yes` for item invoices that go through `reference/inventory.md`.
10. **Accounting Invoice Mode — always use `LEDGERENTRIES.LIST`**: when `OBJVIEW="Invoice Voucher View"` is set (Modes 1 and 2 in `reference/vouchers.md`), every ledger block **must** use `<LEDGERENTRIES.LIST>`, not `<ALLLEDGERENTRIES.LIST>`. Tally silently ignores `ALLLEDGERENTRIES` in this view, causing the voucher to be saved with no entries and the error "No accounting or inventory entries are available."
11. **Voucher class decision — confirm before posting**: before posting any Purchase or Sales voucher, check whether the company's voucher type uses a class for GST splitting. Run the preflight checklist in the "Preflight checklist before posting" section below. If class mode is confirmed, set `<CLASSNAME>EXACT_CLASS_NAME</CLASSNAME>` in the voucher header and include all four GST header fields (`CMPGSTIN`, `PARTYGSTIN`, `GSTREGISTRATIONTYPE`, `PLACEOFSUPPLY`). **If class existence is unconfirmed, stop and ask — do not post without it.** Full decision rules and templates are in the "Voucher class — decision rules" section of `reference/vouchers.md`.

## Preflight checklist before posting

Run through every item before sending any Create/Alter/Delete request. **Stop at the first unresolved item and ask the user.**

| # | Check | How to verify | Block if… |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Company confirmed** | User stated it explicitly | Name not given — ask |
| 2 | **Server reachable** | `curl -s --max-time 5 "$TALLY_URL"` | No response / wrong port |
| 3 | **Voucher type uses a class?** | Export voucher type masters or ask user | Unknown — ask before posting |
| 4 | **Class name confirmed** (if class mode) | List voucher type via masters export; match exact class name in Tally | Class not found — ask, never guess |
| 5 | **Party ledger exists** | Ledger existence check (`reference/masters.md`) | Missing — create first |
| 6 | **Purchase/Sales/GST ledgers exist** | Same as above | Missing — create first |
| 7 | **GST header fields available** (if class mode) | `CMPGSTIN`, `PARTYGSTIN`, `GSTREGISTRATIONTYPE`, `PLACEOFSUPPLY` | Any missing — ask user |
| 8 | **Voucher totals balance** | Sum all `AMOUNT` values = 0 | Mismatch — fix before posting |

## Step 0: Check TallyPrime server

```bash
curl -s --max-time 5 "$TALLY_URL"
```

Expected (example):

```xml
<RESPONSE>TallyPrime Server is Running</RESPONSE>
```

If not running, stop and ask user to open TallyPrime and enable integrations for the port.

## Step 1: Company context

If the user did not specify company, ask. If they did, use **exact** name in `SVCURRENTCOMPANY`.

To list companies, use the template in `reference/reports.md` (“Company list”).

## Step 2: Verify/create required ledgers (masters)

Ledger existence checks and master creation templates are in `reference/masters.md` (includes ledgers, groups, GST/address fields, and party ledger creation with required field prompts).

**New company?** Run the "New Company Setup — Standard GST Ledgers" block in `reference/masters.md` first. It creates the seven minimum ledgers every GST-registered company needs:

| # | Ledger | Type |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `Input Sgst @ 9 %` | Input GST |
| 2 | `Input Cgst @ 9 %` | Input GST |
| 3 | `Input IGST @ 18 %` | Input GST |
| 4 | `Purchase @ 18 %` | Purchase ledger |
| 5 | `Round Off` | Rounding |
| 6 | `Output Sgst @ 9 %` | Output GST |
| 7 | `Output Cgst @ 9 %` | Output GST |

Quick group defaults (common CA mapping):

| Ledger type | Parent group |
|---|---|
| Customer | `Sundry Debtors` |
| Vendor | `Sundry Creditors` |
| Sales | `Sales Accounts` |
| Purchases/Expenses | `Purchase Accounts` / `Direct Expenses` / `Indirect Expenses` |
| Bank | `Bank Accounts` |
| Cash | `Cash-in-Hand` |
| GST | `Duties & Taxes` |

## Step 3: Post vouchers (core)

Use `REPORTNAME=Vouchers` and always include `GUID`, `DATE`, and `VOUCHERTYPENAME`. Full templates (including bill-wise allocations, returns, contra) are in `reference/vouchers.md`.

Supported voucher types in this skill:

- Purchase, Sales, Payment, Receipt, Journal
- Credit Note, Debit Note
- Contra
- Voucher Alteration + Cancellation

## Read reports (core)

Use `TALLYREQUEST=Export` / `REPORTNAME=...` with `SVEXPORTFORMAT=$$SysName:XML`. Full templates are in `reference/reports.md`.

Common CA reports:

- **Voucher Register** — fetch all vouchers or filter by type (Payment/Receipt/Contra/etc.) for a date range — use for banking transaction extracts
- Day Book (period)
- Trial Balance (period)
- Balance Sheet
- Profit and Loss
- Ledger Vouchers (ledger statement)
- Bills Receivable / Bills Payable (outstandings)
- Ledger Outstandings / Group Outstandings
- GST: GSTR-1 and related summaries (plus GSTR-3B where available)
- Stock Summary (inventory clients)

## Suggested GUID pattern

Use a deterministic pattern when invoice number exists:

```
{companyShort}-{voucherType}-{voucherNumber}-{date}
```

Examples:

- `abc-purchase-ril2026-00123-20260115`
- `abc-creditnote-cn09-20260302`

## Multi-company CA workflow (recommended)

1. Capture company name early (and confirm spelling).
2. Validate connectivity.
3. Fetch required ledgers/masters or create them.
4. Only then post the voucher.
5. Reply with: company, voucher type, voucher number, date, amount breakdown, and whether any masters were created.

## Bank Statement Import

When importing bank statement transactions (PDF/Excel from bank), use the mapping guide and templates in `reference/vouchers.md` → "Bank Statement Import Workflow". Covers:

- Mapping bank entries to Receipt/Payment/Contra vouchers
- Ledger selection rules (debits, credits, expenses)
- Full XML templates for common bank transactions (NEFT, RTGS, UPI, charges)

## Advanced reference

- Reports and data export: `reference/reports.md`

- Masters (ledgers/groups + GST/address, alteration): `reference/masters.md`
